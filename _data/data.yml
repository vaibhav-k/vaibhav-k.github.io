    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      The candidate is an experienced data scientist with a strong background 
      in machine learning and deep learning. Currently, at Wi-Tronix, they 
      develop models to analyze train cockpit and infrastructure footage. 
      Previously, at Slytek, they implemented real-time video analysis and 
      developed CI/CD pipelines. Their experience includes a machine learning 
      internship at SemiCab, focusing on operational email analysis, and a 
      role at Drishti Technologies, where they optimized Kubernetes 
      pipelines and system latency. Their academic background includes a 
      Masterâ€™s in AI from Arizona State University and dual degrees in
      Biological Sciences and Electrical and Electronics Engineering 
      from BITS Pilani. They have contributed to cancer research through 
      internships and publications.

        company: Wi-Tronix, Bolingbrook, IL
        details: |
          - Developed a deep-learning model that analyzes the footage 
          captured by cameras in train cockpits to monitor driver activity.
          - Assisted in developing a series of deep learning models that analyze 
          the footage captured by outward-facing cameras in trains to monitor 
          the condition of the crossing infrastructure, such as the gate arm.

        company: Slytek, Denver, CO
        details: |
          - Integrated Raspberry Pi 4Bs with Camera Module 3s to analyze the 
          video feed and verify the operator's compliance with the standard 
          operating procedures.
          - Created a CI/CD pipeline for a C++ application that uses a 
          combination of unit tests, Azure, and Docker.
          - Interfaced a Raspberry Pi 4 and an ADE9000 to get voltage, current, 
          and power measurements.
      - role: Machine Learning Intern
        time: 05/2022 - 08/2022
        company: SemiCab, Atlanta, GA
        details: |
          - Parsed the operations-related emails received by the company and 
          then classified them intent-wise before extracting relevant 
          information from it.
          - Used deep learning (transfer with ULMFiT as the base model) and 
          transformer-based zero- and few-shot learning to tackle the 
          problem of less training data.
          - Clustered the emails into distinct clusters using DBSCAN for 
          categorized downstream processing.
      - role: Machine Learning Engineer
        time: 01/2021 - 08/2021
        company: Drishti, Bangalore, IN
        details: |
          - Created some new deep-learning model KubeFlow Pipelines that 
          generated temporal proposals (BMN) with about 5% higher accuracy.
          - Reduced the end-to-end per-frame system latency in the 
          streaming pipeline by about 50%.
          - Migrated the essential DL model-related operations from an old 
          API to a new one for easier and more consistent processing.
